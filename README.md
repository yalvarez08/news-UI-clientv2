## Why React?

React was chosen for its rich ecosystem of development tools, ease of component-based architecture, and widespread community support. Compared to backend frameworks like Go or Rails, React and the broader JavaScript frontend ecosystem provide significantly better developer experience for UI-centric tasksâ€”especially when rapid iteration and responsive design are required.

While tools like Rails offer frontend integrations (e.g., Rails + React), they often increase complexity without much payoff. Managing them inside a monolithic project can be cumbersome, essentially becoming another project within a project. Keeping the frontend as a standalone React application promotes better separation of concerns and avoids the overhead of tightly coupled full-stack frameworks.
